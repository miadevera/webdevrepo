For the fianl project I am stickkng with the same website that I had for the midterm.
#Final Project Ideas 
I will have all the pages filled out with pictures and text relating to the named navigation text.
On the photos I will have an option to hover over the photo and be a able to click through the photos with arrows on each side of then photo allowing the user to expolore multiple photos under one photo.
I will have a shop page fully set up that lets you see available art for purchase and redirects you to my etsy page to buy the art and other listings.
I will have the about me set up to where you can join my newsletter, be able to leave a question and be contacted after filling out your information.
This website will not only be my portfolio but could be used as a resume to employers in the software development field and other various job fields.
