Here is my final project!

I wanted to make this website unique and I feel like thats exactly what I did with this final project. First off I made the collage page photos a bootstrap carousel which was a challenge.

I also wanted to do some fun JS and made a glowing circle follow my mouse on some of the pages. I am really proud of being able to do that. 

Another thing I did in JS was make the scrolling text and bouncing link. Those two on the same page making people go to my shop was so fun to do and try to understand. 

I also added a fun "SOON" text with back glow on the pages that I am not quite ready to put thinhs on yet. 

I also updated the picture on the index.html page

I also changed the color of the nav bar and body to give all the pages a more colorful taste when visiting my site rather then the old grey and white combo.

Overall I am very happy with how this website turned out and I can't wait to keep updating this website and making chnages and make it a website that I will use and update forever.
