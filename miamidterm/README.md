Final proposal!
still following my midterm for an art portfolio but i want to make it a little more bloggy. so still have the content i make but i want to make it feel more personal by having at least a page where i can talk about my inspirations and my progress

- hover over collection of photos to show carousel slides using bootstrap
- embed my written resume and my etsy shop... access both without leaving site
- smoother transition between pages
