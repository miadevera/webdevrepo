        <!-- SICKLE CELL MODEL -->
        <section class="project-block">
            <h1>Sickle Cell Model</h1>
            <p>
                This project is an educational model for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s hematology team to give
                information to parents about what sickle cell disease is and how to identify it in their infants. It teaches
                them how to palpate a spleen, look at the coloring of jaundice in different skin tones, and what dactilytis
                limbs look like in comparison to if they were normal displayed through a baby doll and an informational
                pamphlet.<br><br>
                <strong>Technical Description:</strong><br>
                I used Blender, 3D printing, and silicone molding to create an accurate model of an enlarged spleen. I worked
                with Medical Illustration interns to study and recreate what dactilytis feet and hands look like, and to create
                a diagram of normal skin tones and the sclera of the eyes versus if the infant has jaundice. The limbs and spleen
                are then incorporated into an accurately sized baby doll.<br><br>

        <!-- HORSE MODEL -->
        <section class="project-block">
            <h1>Horse Model</h1>
            <p>
                This project was for the University of Pennsylvania’s Veterinary program. The purpose was to clean up CT scans
                of a horse to create a 3D printed horse model to assist in the education of horse anatomy for students. This
                project was also to prevent the school from having to find more deceased horses for educating.<br><br>
                <strong>Technical Description:</strong><br>
                I used Mimics to clean up the scans and 3Matic to put the scanned sections of the horse together. Mimics uses
                the scans to create a 3D model. I was not present for the printing of the models, but if I were, they would be
                life-sized.<br><br>
