Concept/Skill that we learned and that I will use on site: Navbar, Paddings, Margins, Linking different pages.
Things I want to learn to use on site: Changing color of text when hovering on words. How to insert various photos on different layers, How to make it so when clicking on a linked tab it stays on same tab instead of opening up a new one.
