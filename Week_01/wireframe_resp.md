# wireframe response

there are five things to consider white wireframing... the UX experience is much more than problem solving 
but it relies on different teams and their ability to work together.the basics, wireframing, can be the most
efficient way of working on a project.

1. clarifying the problem
   what's the project...the problem... how do we know its a problem... who is it for... where is this info going to live

   the firstmost bridge to cross is identifying the initial problem and acknowledge the teams from there

2. workflows and sketches
   how will it look... what is the formatting... what happens if there is an error

   the next step is the ability to visual a basic format to run the rest the wireframing

3. get early feedback
   show others the possible solution

   this helps to determine the amount of time needed to complete code since a new module can easily take at
   least 6 months to code

4. know your tools
   with final approval of sketches you can clean up the designs... omnigraffle is a good go-to tool for wireframes

   it's best to get comfortable with and have a set 'toolbox' to save time

5. know your audience
   every team communicates and understands problems differently so wireframes should be tailored accordingly

   high-fidelity wireframes who need to see the concept as realistic as possible and low-fidelity for those
   who need to know the simple elements and functions

- conclusion
  always know your audience and that should take you on the right track of how to make the appropriate wireframe
  efficiently and effectively
